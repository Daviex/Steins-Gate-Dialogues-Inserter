This tool has been created to extract dialogues from NSB files of the JUST USA Edition of the game. 

This tool was made for the Italian Steins;Gate Project!

If you use it, just mention where you took it from!

# How it works?
With the other tool, you now have all the txt files from your game.
This tool is thinked to work only with 1 file at time, so, to use it,
you have to drag&drop the text file over the executable of this program.
To make this tool work, be sure that you have in the same folder as the .exe
the folder nss, with all the NSB and MAP files. Also, the file text need to
mantain the same name, don't change from original file.
After you dropped the text file into over the executable, the tool will start
analyzing the file, and importing it. When it finish, you will find a new folder
called importedText, with inside the NSB and MAP file updated.

# How to make it works?
Move the nss folder you decompiled with the archive tool in the same folder as the executable,
pick the text file to import, and drag&drop over the executable, it will start and will create a folder called importedText
with your file.

Enjoy
