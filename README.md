This tool has been created to extract dialogues from NSB files of the JUST USA Edition of the game. 

This tool was made for the Italian Steins;Gate Project!

If you use it, just mention where you took it from!

# How it works?
The tool is based of the idea that for our project we need only dialogues.
Well, after I've analyzed the NSB files, I found out that texts of the game
are saved inside the tags <PRE></PRE>, so everything is inside those tags are dialogues,
and also set person who is talking, the animation etc.

So, I'm going through every single file, and check out for those tags,
and, when I found them, I save them and after I'm going to write them down to a file txt.

# How to make it works?
Move the nss folder you decompiled with the archive tool in the same folder as the executable and execute it, will create a folder called extracted.

Enjoy
